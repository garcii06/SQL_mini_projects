# SQL_mini_projects

The purpose of this repo is to have *mini* projects using `SQL`.📚  
**What is a mini project?** ❓  
Well, I define mini project as files where I can practice SQL topics such as:
 - Cleansing 🧼
 - Profiling 📊
 - Joins 🔑
 - Ad Hoc 🙋‍

Without the necessity of developing a `dashboard`, using other tools such as `Excel` or `R`, or even doing all the process of data analysis.  
This gives me the advantage to practice only specific topics without going to deep.

### Supermarket Analysis 🏪
Practice of Joins, Temporary Tables, Ad Hoc queries.

### Online Retail Analysis 🌐
Practice of CTEs, Data Cleaning, Window Functions.
