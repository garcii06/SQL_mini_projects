# SQL Mini Projects

The purpose of this repository is to show my *mini* projects using `SQL`.📚  
**What is a mini project?** ❓  
 > Well, I define mini project as files where I can practice SQL topics such as:
 - Cleansing 🧼
 - Profiling 📊
 - Joins 🔑
 - Patterns 💮
 - Ad Hoc 🙋‍  

Without the necessity of developing a `dashboard`, using other tools such as `Excel` or `R`, or even doing all the process of data analysis.  
This gives me the advantage to practice only specific topics without going to deep.
